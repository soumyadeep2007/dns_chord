1) When a node joins the Chord ring the minimum number of keys that need to be redistributed is O(1/N).
2) A node's m-bit identifier is generated by taking a SHA-1 hash of its IP address, while key identifiers are derived
from taking similar hashes of the values of each key.
3) python -m da --message-buffer-size 1000000 -F output --logfile --logfilename test_large src/chord/main.da
